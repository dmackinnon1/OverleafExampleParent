# OverleafExampleParent
This repo has the `StandardOverleafExample` as a submodule and stores the PDF produced by that example in a publically accessible way.

A GitHub Action, `PDF Compile Action`, will compile the `StandardOverleafExample` and update the PDF stored in this (the parent) repository.
